# Why a fork

The aim of this repository is to refactor the code in way that it is easier to include into other ESP based projects.
Reading and understanding the code turned out to be quite difficult. The hope is that seperating the functionality into modules makes it easier to understand and simpler to reuse in different contexts with the required changes.
